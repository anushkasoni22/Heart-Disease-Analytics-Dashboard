## 📖 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end analytics dashboard designed to identify key drivers of heart disease and simulate the impact of lifestyle changes. Using a massive dataset from the **CDC (2020 & 2022)**, it moves beyond simple charts to provide **Predictive AI Insights** and **Prescriptive Strategies**.

### 🎯 Key Objectives:
* **Analyze** the correlation between lifestyle choices (Smoking, Sleep, BMI) and Heart Health.
* **Identify** high-risk demographics and comorbidity hotspots.
* **Simulate** how reducing obesity and smoking rates can mathematically lower disease prevalence.

### 📄 Page 1: Descriptive Analysis (Demographics)
*Who is most at risk? A breakdown of age, gender, and perception.*
* **Visuals:** Impact of Smoking, Heart Risk by Sleep Duration, Risk by Age Group.
* **Key Insight:** analyzed the gap between "Health Perception vs. Reality".

---

### 🌍 Page 2: 2022 Geographic & Advanced Risk Factors
*A deep dive into the 2022 dataset focusing on environmental and specific physical traits.*
* **Hotspots:** US Geographic Risk Map.
* **Critical Factors:** Impact of **Lung Disease (COPD)**, **Mental Health**, and **Oral Health (Teeth Loss)** on heart risk.
* **Mobility:** Risk analysis based on Walking Difficulty.

---

### 🧬 Page 3: Deep Dive - Comorbidities & Lifestyle
*Understanding the "Lifestyle Paradox" and how conditions multiply.*
* **The Lifestyle Paradox:** Is "Sitting" worse than Smoking?
* **Root Cause Analysis:** How multiple conditions (Comorbidities) multiply the risk factor.
* **Warning Signs:** The impact of Chest Pain (Angina).

---

### ⚖️ Page 4: What Drives Heart Disease?
*Correlating physical attributes with disease probability.*
* **Metrics:** Average BMI Score & Smoker Ratios.
* **Visuals:** BMI vs. Physical Activity, Risk by Kidney Status, and Stroke History impact.

---

### 🤖 Page 5: Predictive Driver Analysis (AI Powered)
*Using Power BI's Key Influencers to find hidden patterns.*
* **Root Cause Analysis:** Automated insights identifying Top Factors (Age Category, Race, General Health) that increase risk.
* **Slicers:** Dynamic filtering by Age, Sex, and Smoking status.

---

### 🔮 Page 6: Prescriptive Analysis (Scenario Simulation)
*The most powerful feature: A "What-If" Simulation Engine.*
* **Simulation Engine:** Sliders to adjust **Physical Activity %**, **Smoking %**, and **Obesity %**.
* **Outcome:** A dynamic bar chart showing **"Current vs. Projected Impact"** and a counter for **"Lives Potentially Saved"**.
* **Strategy:** Recommendation Box with actionable health steps.
